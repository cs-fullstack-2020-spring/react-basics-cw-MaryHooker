# React Basics CW
#### Nice job. Looks like you accidentally deleted you class on the Hulu Component like we discussed in class so the text is the same color as the background. Once the class was added back it looks great!
#### Score : 4/5
Create a new react app

Create a new Hulu Component
* pass an object with properties showTitle, numberOfSeason, genre, and rating to the component 
* Return the show information formatted however you like (all properties must be displayed in the browser)

Call the component from the default parent component

Style the default parent component
